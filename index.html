        <p>This repository is a part of a conference paper cited below.<br>D. Kar and S. Prasad Kar, “<em>An I-voting system
                using dual-blockchain architecture</em>,” Interdisciplinary Research in Technology and Management,
            <strong>pp. 213–222</strong>, Apr. 2024. doi:<a

        <p>This is a blockchain-inspired &quot;Internet&quot; voting system that demonstrates how a blockchain architecture
            can be used to make the voting process more reliable. It keeps track of voters who have been authenticated as
            well as ballots that are cast in two separate, unlinked blockchains. This preserves voter anonymity and achieves
            greater election integrity using an &quot;immutable&quot; audit trail. </p>
        <p>The system allows users to configure their voter roll and ballot with multiple ballot items and multiple
            selections per item. It aims to simulate the decentralized nature of blockchain with a consensus process that
            must take place before votes are recorded on the blockchain using BFTP.</p>
        <h3 id="features">Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>full voting system (registration, authentication, Internet ballot interface)</li>
            <li>interactive (normal) mode vs. simulated election</li>
            <li>demonstrates consensus process among nodes in the blockchain</li>
            <li>adversarial mode (mocks adversary nodes and demonstrates the power of consensus)</li>
            <li>logging (machine logs emulate realistic system messages that are part of the system&#39;s auditing)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
        <p>Docker OR Python 3.5+ &amp; pip</p>
        <h3 id="how-to-run">How to Run</h3>
        <p>You can use <code>docker</code> to run this application. See <a
                href="https://github.com/Debagnik/voting_on_Blockchain/blob/master/README.Docker.md">docker instructions</a>
            for more.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, you can set up the environment using <code>pip</code> to install the dependencies from
            <code>requirements.txt</code> (ideally in a virtual environment).
            Then run <code>python main.py</code>. To customize the software for your own voter roll &amp; ballot, modify
            <code>configs/voter_roll.json</code> and <code>configs/ballot_config.json</code>, respectively.</p>
